# Pairwise-Sequence-Alignment
Bioinformatics Assignment 2, question 1

To run this program start with Main.cpp. 
It will prompt you for the file name. Once you give it a file it can find, it will run and find the global alignment followed by the local alignment. 
You can continue trying new files -- once you want to exit the program, just enter 1 once it's finished aligning. 

test.txt is a test file that was included for test runs. 

In order for the program to find the file, make sure that the test file is saved in "cmake-build-debug" wherever the program is. 

The global alignment uses the needleman-wunsch algorithm.
The local alignment uses the smith-waterman algorithm.
